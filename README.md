This is a challenge from [https://devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) that I took upon myselft to hone my Tailwindcss skills on. It's a first project for which I used
Tailwindcss and the complete project was styled using only tailwindcss utility classes. I also created a custom tailwind config in which I customize the colors, spacings and I've added a custom plugin for a "checked-siblig" variant which adds a class to an element if it's sibling (radio or checkbox input) is checked. Hope you like it!
