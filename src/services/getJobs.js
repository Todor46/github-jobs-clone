I am currently a Cloud Solution Architect working with Azure offerings. I’d say I am not your typical solution architect as my background is actually in Business Administration that I’ve studied at Stockholm’s University and I really like strategic management. I moved into IT as a developer a couple of years ago to follow my passion for technology. Working in this part of the business gives me opportunity to combine both strategic management and IT, while being part of Microsoft makes this work even more fun and developing. There are endless opportunities to learn and try new things, and you have access to a bunch of resources through our library, as well as industry experts through the internal communities. When I am not working, I try new food together with my friends, drag them all on big group trips and events, or do yoga.</li>\n<li>…..I am Dennis van de Wege, Cloud Solutions Architect on the field of Azure Apps &amp; Infra. I was never the IT guy. I actually wanted to become a fighter pilot for the Royal Air Force in the Netherlands. Then at the beginning of 2017 a company from Rotterdam reached out to me if I was interested in a traineeship working with hybrid cloud. I accepted their offer and rolled into the program. This changed my life.</li>\n<li>After two years I was contacted by Microsoft. As a CSA my work basically is to be the trusted technical advisor of my customers. I am the technical person that helps customers with technical questions, concerns and issues. One example is that I lead deep technical architecture discussions with senior customer executives, architects, IT Management and developers to drive core infrastructure solutions and data centre migrations. Another example is that I can reach out to various resources within Microsoft for specific knowledge. Within my work it’s also great that I always keep learning. You have the opportunity to teach, to learn and to visit and meet with colleagues that are the absolute world experts in their field.</li>\n<li>Meet more CSAs</li>\n<li>... we would love to hear from you</li>\n<li>Microsoft values different life experiences and viewpoints. We seek out people from diverse backgrounds and encourage them to take risks and approach challenges unconventionally. We will invest in your health and financial future, and encourage you to pursue your interests and passions away from the office. Our products and technologies help you balance life away from the office and enable you to manage your schedule efficiently.</li>\n<li>Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer and supports workforce diversity.

Our success depends substantially on a web portal that enables customers (and employees) to perform daily actions such as booking sea-freights and ordering containers. It’s a valuable 24/7 resource, run by an experienced team that is committed to the highest professional standards. If you think you could take the lead in front-end web development for this portal, please read on.</p>\n<h2>Front-end excellence within a collaborative and professional environment</h2>\n<p>You will be part of the team that focuses on developing a robust and efficient Customer Portal (Service Web). The team works with legacy systems such as ReactJS and AngularJS (maintained by Facebook) and .NET Core and ASP.NET stack (maintained by Microsoft).</p>\n<p>Central to this effort is the ongoing development of attractive and user-friendly UIs. Your role is to act as team leader for this front-end web development, evolving interesting web designs that hundreds of people can easily interact with and rely on every day.</p>\n<p>The development team strives for mature, stable development frameworks that deliver competitive software performance, eliminate the risk of failure, and ensure scalability for future developments. This is achieved through continuous development within an agile, modernized software environment where business needs can be solved quickly on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<h2>Flexible, professional and organized</h2>\n<p>As a Front-End Web Developer, you need the flexibility necessary to deliver predefined web designs while at the same time taking the initiative and proposing improvements to existing designs. Further, you should be an organized multi-tasker who can commit to a predefined sprint plan whilst also performing hotfixes that need to be solved ASAP. And you always show up on time for team meetings such as Planning-, Retro-, Daily- and Demo meetings. Your specific responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining and developing fully scalable websites and securing professional UX;</li>\n<li>Taking the lead in front-end web development;</li>\n<li>Implementing professional web designs and deliver UIs that attract users;</li>\n<li>Dealing with ad-hoc requirements and/or issues with web designs your team is responsible for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>This is the place to get ahead</h2>\n<p>Samskip is committed to innovating and applying sustainable and multimodal transport links across Europe. Our office in Cluj-Napoca plays an important role in this network.

In particular, you have extensive experience with frameworks such as ReactJS, Angular, Vue etc. As a leader, you also need knowledge of stylesheets such as CSS / SASS / LESS.</p>\n<p>Implementing a proposed web design comes naturally to you, and you have a sharp eye for general UX improvements. It is essential that you always think in terms of finding universal scalability and you go the extra mile for fully scalable web designs. Above all, you love working in SCRUM / Kanban Agile continuous development environment. We are a cross-functional team working with a mono-repo so experience of collaborative development with Git is key. The back-end is mostly RESTful .NET APIs, so basic C# experience is a big plus.</p>\n<p>You also know your way around CSS, LESS, SASS, REST, HTTP, Swagger, Angular, React and Git.

      "description": "<p><strong>Become part of a highly professional and future-focused software development team that is integral to the success of our international transport operations</strong></p>\n<p>Samskip is a large, international company that organizes thousands of transport movements every week. Our web portal acts as an essential tool that our customers (and employees) rely on to perform actions such as booking sea-freights and ordering containers. It’s a valuable 24/7 resource, run by an experienced team that is committed to the highest professional standards. If you have the skills to become part of that team as it collaborates to develop interesting IT products, read on and find out more about Samskip.</p>\n<h2>Agile and continuous development for evolving business needs</h2>\n<p>You will be a part of the team that focuses on developing a Customer Portal (Service Web) whose main purpose is to enable communication between the company’s IT systems, combining their core features into a user-friendly web portal. Working with legacy systems such as ReactJS and AngularJS (maintained by Facebook) and .NET Core and ASP.NET stack (maintained by Microsoft), we deploy robust IT systems that specialize in certain domains.</p>\n<p>The development team strives for mature, stable development frameworks that deliver competitive software performance, eliminate the risk of failure, and ensure scalability for future developments. The team practices continuous development within an agile, modernized software environment where business needs can be solved quickly on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<h2>Flexible, professional and organized</h2>\n<p>As a Full Stack Software Engineer you need the flexibility to work on specialized front- and back-end projects simultaneously. Further, you should be an organized multi-tasker who can commit to a predefined sprint plan whilst also performing hotfixes that need to be solved ASAP. We expect professional results and you must be on time for Planning-, Retro-, Daily- and Demo meetings. Your specific responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining and developing end-to-end fully scalable websites;</li>\n<li>Implementing and documenting stable web APIs which are relied on by both internal software teams and/or 3rd parties;</li>\n<li>Implementing professional web designs and deliver UIs that attract users;</li>\n<li>Dealing with ad-hoc requirements and/or issues with web products your team is responsible for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A great career in a great company</h2>\n<p>Samskip is committed to innovating and applying sustainable and multimodal transport links across Europe. Our office in Cluj-Napoca plays an important role in this network.
